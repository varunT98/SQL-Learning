GROUP BY : The GROUP BY clause is used to aggregate data across multiple records and group the result set by one or more columns. 
It's often used with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), etc.

ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set by one or more columns. 
You can specify whether the sorting should be in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
